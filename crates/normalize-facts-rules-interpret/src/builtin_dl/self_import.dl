#
# A file importing itself is almost always a copy-paste error. It creates a
# circular dependency with zero benefit: the file already has access to its
# own symbols without importing them.
#
# ## How to fix
#
# Remove the self-import. Check whether the import was intended to reference
# a different module with a similar name.
#
# ## When to disable
#
# Almost never justified. There is no meaningful case where a file needs to
# import itself.
