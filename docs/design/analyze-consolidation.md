# Analyze Command Consolidation

Status: **design** — phased implementation in progress.

## Problem

`normalize analyze` has 49 subcommands. Each is a hardcoded point in a 4-dimensional space:

| Axis | Values |
|------|--------|
| **Metric** | complexity, length, density, ceremony, uniqueness, test-ratio, budget, health, duplicates, coupling, churn, ownership, surface, depth, layering, calls, docs, security |
| **Scope** | function, file, module, codebase, cross-repo |
| **Time** | snapshot (now), vs-ref (diff against a commit), over-history (trend) |
| **Shape** | score, ranked-list, grouped/clustered, graph/tree, diff |

For example:
- `coupling-clusters` = coupling × module × snapshot × grouped
- `skeleton-diff` = structure × codebase × vs-ref × diff
- `trend` = health × codebase × over-history × time-series
- `module-health` = health × module × snapshot × ranked-list

Users don't think in named intersections. They think: "show me coupling, but grouped" or "how has health changed over time?" The current model forces memorizing 49 names.

## Design: Composable Families

### Phase 1 — Cross-cutting modifiers (future)

Add `--trend` and `--diff <ref>` as universal modifiers on any scoring command. This is highest leverage but requires the most infrastructure (any command that returns a score needs to be runnable at arbitrary commits). Deferred until Phase 2 proves the family model works.

### Phase 2 — Merge families with compatible parameters

Merge commands that share most parameters into a single command with view flags. Delete old names (no aliases — we're at v0.1.0).

**Only merge when parameter signatures are compatible.** If one view has 5+ unique params, or params are semantically different (target path vs repos directory), they're different commands.

**2a. ~~`health` family~~** — NOT MERGING. `health`, `module-health`, `cross-repo-health` have divergent params (target vs limit+min_lines vs repos_dir). Keep separate.

**2b. `coverage` family** (done):
```
normalize analyze coverage                   # was: test-ratio (default)
normalize analyze coverage --gaps            # was: test-gaps
normalize analyze coverage --budget          # was: budget
```

**2c. ~~`density` family~~** — NOT MERGING. `uniqueness` has 8 unique params. Keep `density`, `uniqueness`, `ceremony` separate.

**2d. `churn` family** (done):
```
normalize analyze churn                      # was: coupling (default)
normalize analyze churn --cluster            # was: coupling-clusters
normalize analyze churn --hotspots           # was: hotspots
```
All three are temporal co-change analyses from git history.

### Phase 3 — Concept graph decomposition

Instead of asking "which commands can merge?", ask: "what are the underlying concepts, and which generalize?"

#### Entities (nodes in the concept graph)

```
symbol (function, type, trait)
file
module (directory)
commit
author
repo
```

#### Properties (computed per entity)

```
complexity(symbol)        → cyclomatic count
lines(symbol|file)        → line count
is_test(symbol|file)      → bool
is_public(symbol)         → bool
has_doc(symbol)           → bool
is_boilerplate(symbol)    → trait impl / interface
hash(symbol|block)        → exact content hash
minhash(symbol|block)     → similarity signature
skeleton(symbol)          → control-flow shape
compression_ratio(module) → information density
```

#### Relations (edges)

```
contains(file, symbol)
contains(module, file)
calls(symbol, symbol)
imports(file, file)
changed_in(file, commit)
authored_by(commit, author)
similar_to(symbol, symbol, score)
duplicate_of(symbol, symbol)
tests(symbol, symbol)
```

#### Derived metrics (compositions)

```
churn(file)       = count(changed_in(file, _))
coupling(f1, f2)  = |commits(f1) ∩ commits(f2)|
hotspot(file)     = churn(file) × avg_complexity(file)
ownership(file)   = concentration(authors(blame(file)))
fan_in(module)    = count(imports(_, module))
depth(module)     = max_path(import_dag, module)
test_ratio(mod)   = lines(tests_in(mod)) / lines(impl_in(mod))
uniqueness(mod)   = 1 - fraction_with_similar_to(mod)
```

#### Four extensible patterns

All 44 commands decompose into 4 extensible patterns + specific features + composites:

**1. `rank <metric>` — score entities, show worst-first (open set)**

New metrics plug in naturally. Today this covers ~15 commands:
complexity, length, files, size, density, uniqueness, ceremony, ownership, imports, depth-map, surface, layering, docs.

All share the same shape: compute a scalar per entity, sort, show top N. The metric and entity scope differ but the machinery is identical.

**2. `similar` — find structurally alike code units (open set)**

Today: duplicate-functions, duplicate-blocks, duplicate-types, similar-functions, similar-blocks, clusters, patterns. All 7 ask "which code units look alike?" Parameters are scope (function/block/type), method (exact/fuzzy/skeleton), and grouping (pairs/groups/clusters).

Could become: `similar --scope functions|blocks|types --mode exact|fuzzy|skeleton [--cluster]`

**3. `graph <symbol>` — walk relations from a starting point (open set)**

Today: call-graph, callers, callees, trace, impact. All walk the call/dependency graph from a symbol. Direction (up/down/both) and depth (direct/transitive) differ.

Could become: `graph <symbol> [--callers|--callees|--both] [--transitive] [--impact]`

**4. `check` — find violations / scan for problems (→ subsumes into rules engine)**

Today: docs, check-refs, stale-docs, check-examples, security. All scan files for violations of some predicate. Many could eventually become tree-sitter rules rather than hardcoded commands. The `rules` engine already does this for user-defined patterns.

#### Specific features (closed set — don't generalize)

- `churn` — temporal analysis from git history (already unified, 3 views)
- `coverage` — test coverage analysis (already unified, 3 views)
- `skeleton-diff` — structural comparison vs a ref
- `provenance` — blame → session mapping
- `architecture` — composite coupling+cycles+hubs report

#### Composites (presentation, not concepts)

- `health`, `module-health`, `cross-repo-health`, `summary`, `all`, `trend`
- These run other concepts and aggregate. They're dashboards.
- Cross-repo variants (`cross-repo-health`, `activity`, `contributors`, `repo-coupling`) are the same concepts applied at a wider scope.

#### Extensibility verdict

| Pattern | Open/Closed | Generalizes? | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `rank <metric>` | Open — new metrics frequently | Yes, highest leverage | High |
| `similar` | Open — new scopes/methods | Yes, 7 → 1 | High |
| `graph` | Open — new relation types | Yes, 5 → 1 | Medium |
| `check` | Open — → rules engine | Already happening | Low (already have `rules`) |
| `churn` | Closed | Done | — |
| `coverage` | Closed | Done | — |
| Composites | Closed | Not worth merging (param divergence) | — |

#### What this means for the CLI

The target isn't "merge commands with compatible params." It's:

1. **`rank`**: Register metrics as a pluggable catalog. `normalize analyze rank complexity`, `normalize analyze rank density`, etc. Or keep short names (`complexity`, `density`) but backed by a shared `rank` infrastructure that gives all of them `--trend`, `--diff`, cross-repo support for free.

2. **`similar`**: One command with scope + mode flags. Delete 7 commands, add 1.

3. **`graph`**: One command with direction + depth flags. Delete 5 commands, add 1.

4. **`check`**: Migrate hardcoded checks to the rules engine over time. No command-level change needed.

This would take 44 → ~20 commands, and more importantly, make the *extension model* obvious: adding a new metric is "register a scorer", not "add a command + args + dispatch + snapshot test."

## Implementation Strategy

Each merge follows this pattern:

1. Add view flag(s) to the parent command's service method
2. Dispatch to the appropriate analysis function based on the flag
3. Return an enum wrapper type (e.g. `CoverageOutput`) with `OutputFormatter` delegation
4. **Delete the old commands** — no aliases, no backward compat at v0.1.0
5. Update snapshot tests

## Command Count

| Phase | Commands | Reduction |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Start | 49 | — |
| After Phase 2 (coverage + churn merged, old deleted) | 43 | -6 |
| After `similar` consolidation | 37 | -6 |
| After `graph` consolidation | 33 | -4 |
| After `check` → rules migration | ~30 | ~-3 |

The goal isn't minimizing count for its own sake — it's making the mental model learnable and the extension model obvious.

## Implementation Progress

### Done

**`coverage`** — unifies `test-ratio`, `test-gaps`, `budget`:
- `normalize analyze coverage` → test-ratio (default)
- `normalize analyze coverage --gaps` → test-gaps
- `normalize analyze coverage --budget` → budget
- Enum: `CoverageOutput` in `commands/analyze/coverage.rs`
- Old commands: `test-ratio`, `test-gaps`, `budget` — delete once coverage is proven

**`churn`** — unifies `coupling`, `coupling-clusters`, `hotspots`:
- `normalize analyze churn` → coupling pairs (default)
- `normalize analyze churn --cluster` → coupling-clusters
- `normalize analyze churn --hotspots` → hotspots
- Enum: `CouplingOutput` in `commands/analyze/coupling_views.rs`
- Old commands: `coupling`, `coupling-clusters`, `hotspots` — delete once churn is proven

### Not merging (by design)

**`health`, `module-health`, `cross-repo-health`**: Different parameter signatures (target vs limit+min_lines vs repos_dir) mean these are genuinely different commands, not views of one command. Forcing them under one method creates a god-function with mostly-unused params. Keep separate.

**`density`, `uniqueness`, `ceremony`**: `uniqueness` has 8 unique params. Merging creates a 15-flag method where most flags are irrelevant to 2 of 3 views. Keep separate.

### Pattern Learned

Enum wrapper (`CoverageOutput`, `CouplingOutput`) + `OutputFormatter` delegation works well when:
- Views share most parameters (root, limit, exclude, only)
- View-specific params are few and can be `Option`

It doesn't work when parameter signatures diverge — that means they're different commands, not different views. Don't force a merge with aliases or god-functions; accept that separate commands are the right design.

**No aliases.** We're at v0.1.0 with no external users depending on old names. Old commands get deleted, not aliased. Aliases double surface area and never get cleaned up.
