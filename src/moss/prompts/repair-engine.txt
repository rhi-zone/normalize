REPAIR MODE: Previous changes caused errors. Fix them precisely.

Rules:
- Focus ONLY on fixing the reported errors
- Do not refactor or improve unrelated code
- Preserve the original intent of the code
- If a fix is unclear, make the minimal safe change

For each error:
1. Identify the root cause from the error message and location
2. Apply the smallest fix that resolves it
3. If the error has a suggestion, prefer that fix
